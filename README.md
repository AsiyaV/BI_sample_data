# BI_sample_data

## Instructions: 
Complete the exercises to the best of your ability. There is no right or wrong answer.  The data is constructed in a way that allows identifying a few trends, and a couple of issues.

#### Delivery:
- Summary: describe your thought process, what you did, think as if you are marking slides for someone else in the team who will have to present them and explain the work and the findings. ~1000 words (pdf)
- 3-4 slides (presentation), 1-2 slides per exercise showing trend and impact (pdf)
- send to Wendy or follow her instructions

#### Industry metrics:
- Gross Revenue: top line revenue
- Net Revenue: total revenue platform keeps after a buyer transaction is completed
- Margin: Net Revenue/Gross Revenue
- Impressions: unit of transaction, ie. buyer purchases an ad on a publisher's site and that ad is viewed by the user
- eCPM: Revenue/ Impressions * 1000 - this is a unit of transaction value
- Ad Requests: ad opportunities volume

### Exercise 1
- explore DataSet1 as a monthly trend
- Typical questions we look to answer (you don't have to answer all of them but rather use them a guide for data exploration):
  - Is revenue trending up or down: which publishers are driving which change?
  - How do eCPMs vary by the transaction or format type?
  - Which sales regions prevail?
  - Is there a specific buyer causing an issue? Who are the top buyers?
  - Which transactions types are most popular and are they consistent across all publishers?
- Pick top 2 most interesting trends and summarize them visually into 1-2 slides (as if you are presenting these findings to upper management or executive team)

### Exercise 2
- Merge DataSet1 and DataSet2
- Typical questions we look to answer (you don't have to answer all of them but rather use them a guide for data exploration):
  - Are the trends in platform 2 similar to the trends you've observed in platfrom 1?
  - Which platform is better/ worse?
  - Are the buyers/ publishers same?
  - Do some buyers willing to pay more $$ to transact on platform 1 vs 2
- Pick top 2 most interesting trends across both platforms and summarize them visually into 1-2 slides (as if you are presenting these findings to upper management or executive team)

#### Key for dataset 2:
